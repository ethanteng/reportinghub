## Key Components

### PermissionsHub
The main component that orchestrates all features and manages the overall application state.

### GroupsTable
Displays Azure AD groups with:
- Transitive member counts
- Group type badges (Security vs M365)
- Dynamic group indicators
- Guest user counts
- Effective permission sets

### PermissionSetsTable
Manages permission sets with:
- CRUD operations
- Capability toggles
- Usage validation
- In-use protection

### ReportAccessMatrix
Shows the access matrix with:
- Group vs Report permissions
- Inheritance vs Override badges
- Bulk assignment tools
- Cell-level override controls

### SetupWizard
3-step guided setup:
1. Group selection
2. Permission assignment
3. Configuration review

## Mock Data

The application uses realistic mock Azure AD data including:
- Multiple tenants (Contoso, Fabrikam)
- Various group types (Security, M365, Dynamic)
- Guest users with `#EXT#` UPN format
- Nested group structures
- Permission sets and assignments

## State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management with the following key state:
- Current tenant selection
- Permission sets (CRUD operations)
- Group assignments (tenant and report level)
- Selected items for bulk operations
- Setup wizard state
- Audit view state

## Azure AD Integration Points

The mock data structure closely mirrors Microsoft Graph API:
- User and Group objects with proper typing
- Transitive membership resolution
- Effective permission calculation
- RLS role support

## Future Enhancements

This prototype is designed to be easily extended with:
- Real Azure AD/Entra ID integration
- Backend API integration
- Advanced audit logging
- Permission templates
- Automated group provisioning
- Compliance reporting

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Code Style

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
